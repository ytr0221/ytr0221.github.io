I'm Yutaro Kawada, a masterâ€™s student at Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences.  
  
My latest work is Horologium Paramecium. In this work, I tried to overwrite human's time with other living thing's time. I measured body clock of paramecium brusaria, and broadcasted it over radio wave that has the same Hz with the one used for adjusting radio clock. If this equipment has placed at home, not only parameciums' time affects human's lifestyle, human's lifestyle also affects parameciums' time.
